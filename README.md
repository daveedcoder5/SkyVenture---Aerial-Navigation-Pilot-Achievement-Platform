## Overview

SkyVenture is a decentralized platform built on the Stacks blockchain that empowers the aerial pilot community through airspace mapping, expedition tracking, and achievement-based rewards. The platform creates a trustless, transparent ecosystem where pilots can discover new airspaces, log their expeditions, share community feedback, and earn SkyVenture Aviator Tokens (SVT) for their contributions.

## Features

### üó∫Ô∏è Airspace Registry
- **Decentralized Mapping**: Register and discover aerial navigation zones with detailed metadata
- **Comprehensive Details**: Location names, coordinates, altitude limits, terrain types, and regulatory information
- **Community Ratings**: Aggregate scoring system based on pilot feedback
- **Discovery Rewards**: Earn 2.7 SVT for each new airspace registered

### ‚úàÔ∏è Expedition Tracking
- **Detailed Logging**: Record flight duration, altitude, weather conditions, and mission purpose
- **Safety Tracking**: Mark expeditions as successful or unsuccessful
- **Performance Metrics**: Automatic calculation of total airtime and expedition counts
- **Completion Incentives**: Earn 2.3 SVT for successful expeditions, 0.575 SVT for incomplete ones

### üë• Aviator Profiles
- **Identity Management**: Customizable handles and craft categories
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor expeditions completed, airspaces discovered, and flight hours
- **Rank System**: Dynamic ranking based on activity and experience (1-5 scale)
- **Achievement System**: Unlock milestones and earn bonus rewards

### üìù Community Feedback
- **Airspace Reviews**: Rate locations from 1-10 with detailed feedback
- **Safety Assessments**: Categorize airspaces as excellent, good, fair, or risky
- **Endorsement System**: Vote on helpful reviews from other pilots
- **Transparent Reputation**: All feedback permanently recorded on-chain

### üèÜ Achievement System
- **Milestone Tracking**: Unlock achievements based on activity thresholds
- **Bonus Rewards**: Earn 9.8 SVT for each achievement unlocked
- **Built-in Achievements**:
  - `pilot-60`: Complete 60 expeditions
  - `explorer-11`: Discover 11 airspaces
- **Extensible Framework**: Easy to add new achievement types

## Token Economics

### SkyVenture Aviator Token (SVT)

- **Token Symbol**: SVT
- **Decimals**: 6
- **Max Supply**: 35,000 SVT
- **Distribution**:
  - Expedition completion: 2.3 SVT (full), 0.575 SVT (partial)
  - Airspace registration: 2.7 SVT
  - Achievement unlock: 9.8 SVT

### Incentive Structure

The token distribution is designed to reward active participation and quality contributions:

1. **Expedition Rewards**: Encourage regular platform usage and accurate logging
2. **Discovery Rewards**: Incentivize expansion of the airspace database
3. **Achievement Bonuses**: Recognize long-term commitment and expertise

## Usage Guide

### Registering an Airspace

```clarity
(contract-call? .skyventure register-airspace
  "Mountain Ridge Vista"
  "40.7128,-74.0060"
  "recreational"
  u400
  "mountain"
  "daylight only"
)
```

### Recording an Expedition

```clarity
(contract-call? .skyventure record-expedition
  u1                    ;; airspace-ref
  u45                   ;; duration-minutes
  u350                  ;; peak-altitude
  "clear"               ;; atmospheric-state
  "photography"         ;; expedition-purpose
  "Captured sunrise footage"  ;; expedition-memo
  true                  ;; completed-safely
)
```

### Submitting Feedback

```clarity
(contract-call? .skyventure submit-feedback
  u1                    ;; airspace-ref
  u9                    ;; score (1-10)
  "Excellent views, clear approach paths, minimal obstructions"
  "excellent"           ;; safety-assessment
)
```

### Unlocking Achievements

```clarity
(contract-call? .skyventure unlock-achievement "pilot-60")
```

### Updating Profile

```clarity
(contract-call? .skyventure update-handle "SkyMaverick")
(contract-call? .skyventure update-craft-category "racing")
```

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [Clarinet](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet) v1.0.0 or higher
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v16+ (for tooling)
- [Stacks CLI](https://docs.stacks.co/docs/cli) (optional)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/skyventure.git
cd skyventure
```

2. Install Clarinet:
```bash
# macOS
brew install clarinet

# Linux/Windows
# Follow instructions at https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet
```

3. Check installation:
```bash
clarinet --version
```

### Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
clarinet test
```

Run specific test files:

```bash
clarinet test tests/skyventure_test.ts
```

### Deployment

1. Configure your deployment settings in `Clarinet.toml`

2. Deploy to testnet:
```bash
clarinet deploy --testnet
```

3. Deploy to mainnet:

clarinet deploy --mainnet
```

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Contract admin is immutable (set to deployer)
- Only aviators can submit feedback for airspaces they haven't reviewed
- Achievements can only be unlocked once per aviator

### Input Validation
- All string inputs are validated for non-zero length
- Numeric inputs are range-checked (e.g., ratings 1-10)
- Altitude limits are enforced during expedition recording
- Token minting respects maximum supply constraints

### Data Integrity
- Duplicate prevention on reviews and achievements
- Immutable expedition and airspace records
- Transparent token distribution tracking

## Error Codes

| Code | Name | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| u100 | `err-admin-only` | Operation requires contract admin privileges |
| u101 | `err-record-not-found` | Requested record does not exist |
| u102 | `err-duplicate-entry` | Entry already exists (reviews, achievements) |
| u103 | `err-access-denied` | Unauthorized operation attempt |
| u104 | `err-invalid-parameter` | Invalid input parameter provided |
